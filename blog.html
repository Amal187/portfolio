            <h1>Introduction:</h1>
            <p>When I first started learning the basics of HTML and CSS, the classes were incredibly instructive, and I quickly grasped the concepts. 
            We had a lot of practise exercises in class and would afterwards look over them to see what further we could do to improve or learn anything we might have missed on the powerpoint slides. 
            My biggest issue was the portion where I had to make the website responsive to both mobile and desktop platforms, as well as download and install GitHub.</p>

            <h1>Progress:</h1>
            <p>My progress of learning html and css has been a rollercoaster, to say the least. 
                I had difficulties starting my website portfolio since I was unsure where to begin, but after obtaining assistance from my colleagues and instructor, I began to understand what to accomplish. 
                I have learnt a lot of CSS tags and how to apply them to organise my website. I still need to practise developing a hamburger menu that only appears on mobile devices, but I have learned how to submit changes and store them on Github, as well as how to structure my website using grid and many other things. 
                I learned how to design and use animations, as well as how to style my paragraphs and columns and structure my website. 
                Lastly, I have learned multiple problem-solving skills since,there would be many issues such as the code not functioning or a difficulty with the structure of the website, but I believe that working on the website portfolio helped me to solve these difficulties and develop skills from them.

            <h1>Summary:</h1>
            <p>In conclusion, I have had my ups and downs with developing my website portfolio, but I have learned a lot of techniques such as how to use CSS styling tags to make my website more appealing, as well as how to avoid using tags such as the br tag to break the line and instead use the p tag, and to avoid using so many div class tags and instead use section class.
                 I learned how to create a website, but I need more practise in other areas, such as making the website more responsive to different devices, but overall, I enjoyed creating the website and feel it was a fantastic learning experience.</p>
