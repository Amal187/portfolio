    <h2>Log of Progress beginning from 27th March 2022 </h2>
    <h3>27th March 2022:</h3>
    <p>I started with the basics for the index page, such as using various design css tags to lay out the structure of the index page. </p>
    <h3>29th March 2022:</h3>
    <p>I began designing a navigation side bar and am having problems since it appears on the left side rather than the right side and is vertical instead of horizontal, but I eventually figured out the solution to the problem.</p>
    <h3>30th March 2022:</h3>
    <p>I have completed the blog and portfolio page. I opted to use the same design structure for both. On each page, there are three columns, each of which is separated into three categories.</p>
    <h3>7th April 2022:</h3>
    <p>I've been experiencing problems with the contact form. 
        It was functioning properly, but I realised I had been using a lot of div classes, and when I replaced them with section classes, the structure became jumbled. 
        I'd want one side to have a contact form that people can fill out with their email addresses, and the other side to include contact information like addresses and phone numbers.</p>
    <h3>10th April 2022:</h3> 
    <p>I had trouble signing in to GitHub and was concerned that all of my commits had been deleted, but everything was sorted out.Â 
        I've also been struggling to make the sites responsive to all devices, but I have tried to come up with a solution for it.</p> 
    <h3>15th April</h3>    
    <p>A few days before submitting and just finishing up all pages and double checking if I have met all the given requirements</p>
